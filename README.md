Assumed various roles and suggested Business Strategy using Power BI and Tableau visualizations. The following business issues were analysed.

1. We are a wine producing company from Italy trying to capture the mid-range and expensive wine market in England. After analyzing the English market, we feel like we have the best quality wines in the world:
		a)	Merlot in Mid-Range and it is the cheapest around the world.
		b)	Prugnolo Gentile in the expensive range and we have the monopoly in the world.
Through this analysis report we would like to convey this huge business opportunity and try to convince the Director of the Board of Investors to give us a “Go-Ahead” to expand our business and enter the English Market.

2. In 2019, Mayor of Boston appointed Boston PD’s new Police Commissioner. The new Commissioner came with a new mindset and new ideas of how to make his task force more effective and efficient. He came to know that Boston PD had employed a new Crime Reporting System in June 2015. He wanted to fully utilize the insights provided by the system to efficiently allocate resources and make his task force more effective in keeping the crime rate down in Boston.
